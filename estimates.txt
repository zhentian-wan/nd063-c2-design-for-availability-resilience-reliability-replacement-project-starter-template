The source database udacity is created in us-east-1 with multiple AZ while the replica is created in us-east-2.

RTO: depends on how quickly to restore a DB instance from the copied snapshot.
RPO: The maximum acceptable amount of time since the last data recovery point.

For multi-AZ: auto failover takes under 1 min to finish
Both RTO and RPO would be 1 min.

For region: When master go down
1. It take around 10min for reponsable person to get notice.
2. Need to manully promote read replica to be new master take around 5 mins.
3. Restore data from snapshot + copy snaphsot to secondary region, 30mins
4. Manully switch new Master RDS domain.
RTO would be around 1 hour.
RPO single region outage - 24 hours (as backup is on a daily basis ie.every 24 hours)
